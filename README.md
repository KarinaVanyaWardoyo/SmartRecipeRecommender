# Smart Recipe Recommender üç≥
Creating a website that can generate recipe ideas based on available ingredients based on user's input. We implement Content-Based Filtering (CBF) recommendation system to suggest recipes based on a user's ingredient input. The system first utilizes TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to transform both the user's ingredients and the recipe dataset into numerical vectors, creating a vocabulary and assigning weights that reflect an ingredient's relevance. Recipes are then compared to the user's input using the Cosine Similarity metric, which measures the angular similarity between their respective vectors to efficiently identify and recommend the most similar recipes with the highest ingredient overlap.
